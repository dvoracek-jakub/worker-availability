# Overview
This tool is designed for managing the current working status of individual employees. Each employee accesses the web application using their unique "key" (secret token) provided in the URL to be able to update their personal status.

**Example URL:**\
`example.org/?token=abcd1234`


### Setup:
To add a new employee, edit the `statuses.json` file. Here, you can also specify the GitHub avatar ID of the employee (the number at the end of the URL, e.g., [https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/**45931076**](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/**45931076**)
).
